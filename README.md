# Classification-of-Heart-Disease-Patients
Nowadays, Heart Diseases in humans are the most common. 
How helpful it would have been, if one could predict a patient would be suffering from Heart Disease or not, or whether he/she may fall for such a situation in future or not. 
So this is data science project making predictions by training and testing data.
Machine Learning Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayesian and K - Nearest Neighbors are applied to the dataset model for analysis!
